# P_Algorithm_Design_and_Analysis_cpp

## What is P_Algorithm_Design_and_Analysis_cpp?

First of all, P is a prefix denoting the practice part in [叶璨铭](https://github.com/2catycm) standard CS learning process. 
As we know, "Practice makes Prefect", CS techniques can never be learned without a hand by hand and visible practice.

On top of that, Algorithm_Design_and_Analysis is a course opened in [Sothern University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/). 
In the spring semester of 2022, the Algorithm_Design_and_Analysis(H-level) Lecture is taught by [Professor Shiqi Yu](https://github.com/ShiqiYu) 

Last but not least, this project is mainly implemented in C++17. 

## Project Structure: How to run this project?
